Programming Assignment 2:  Queues


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe whatever help, if any, that you received on this assignment.
 *     - Include help from people, including course staff, lab TAs,
 *       classmates, and friends. Attribute them by name and include the
 *       date(s) on which they helped you.
 *     - Do not include course materials (such as the course textbook,
 *       lecture videos, and class meetings).
 *     - Write "none" if you did not receive any help.
 *  Here is an example:
 *
 *      9/16/22 Grace Hopper     (faculty)
 *      9/16/22 John von Neumann (lab TA)

[write the dates and help received here]

9/13/24 Arnav Gosain (student) - Suggested using doubly linked list for Deque class to adhere to runtime requirements.
9/13/24 Dillon (Preceptor) - Explained concept of doubly linked list and drew out an example with labeled
front (first) and back (last). Helped visualize addFirst() method by drawing new Node and highlighting which
pointers were changed.
9/13/24 Sami Dalu (Lab TA) - Debugged NullPointerExceptions in Deque and suggested checking for corner cases when initializing Deque as
an empty collection.
9/13/24 Issac Li (Lab TA) - Hinted at swapping out the randomly selected item with the last valid item in the queue
to fulfill runtume requirements that were constant. Debugged incorrect dequeue method that wrongly incremented last
and pointed out inconsistencies in last's definition throughout API.
9/14/24 Steve Ta (student) - reminded me to randomly iterate through RandomizedQueue and suggested creating a copy of my
original array to not change it.
